My name is Muhammad Hazim Bin Nidzam with matrix number, 22001772. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because i love coding.
I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will try my best. Wish me luck!!
